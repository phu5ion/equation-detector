# equation-detector
This saves the backend code for our equation detector. The main code with frontend API is hosted [here](https://github.com/phu5ion/eqnsolver).

Our model detects elements from an image of a handwritten equation, outputs the equation in digital format as well as the answer.

To run this software, type the following command on a bash console:
`python main.py`
