# equation-detector
Detects elements from a handwritten equation, outputs the equation in digital format as well as the answer.

To run this software, type the following command on a bash console:
`python main.py`

We are eventually going to wrap this code in a Flask application for direct input of handwritten equations. Stay tuned for more updates!
